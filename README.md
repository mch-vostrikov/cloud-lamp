# cloud-lamp
This is my try at the cloud lamp. You can google it to get the general idea how the complete thing should look like. I'm using stock hardware and original program.

## Capabilities
For now, basic things I want the lamp to do are:
* imitating thunderstorm because it looks cool;
* emitting gentle warm light as the only actually useful feature;
* slowly randomly changing colors just for the sake of it, might as well be relaxing;
* acivating all above with ir-remote.

## Hardware
I'm using stuff of locally available manufacturer "amperka", but all of these parts either have readily available analogues and/or can be made of available parts.
* Iskra JS (mini)
* WS2811 led pads
* Troyka IR receiver
* IR remote
